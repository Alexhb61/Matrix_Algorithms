# Matrix_Algorithms
Attempts at optimal matrix &amp; linear algebra algorithms
There are currently Three flavours of my attempts at matrix algorithms
1) Faster Boolean Matrix Multiplication through Graph Theory?
    I wrote some algorithms that beat the O(nm) bound for transitive closure SOMETIMES
2) Faster Boolean Matrix Multiplication through Sparsity/Density
    I Wrote some algorithms which under testable conditions efficiently compute matrix multiplication. There is a gap between the dense ones and the sparse ones.
3) Singular Value Decomposition Reduction Chain
    Initially motivated by a universal parallelization attempt, I found parallel and theoretically subcubic algorithms for this problem.
Note:
Posting Date =/= Creation Date
Algorithms are currently pseudo code, but may become cilph code and then tested later.
