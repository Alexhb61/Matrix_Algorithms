# Context
# This Algorithm implied by the pseudocode function BMM is trying to solve the problem of boolean matrix multiplication.
This is standard matrix multiplication but with boolean or in place of plus and boolean and in place of multiplication.
The potential applications of this algorithm include a bunch of graph theory things, and string cfg parsing.

# END PSEUOCODE
#NOTE 1/5 is arbitrary, and causes a double roughly every 3 times
# varying ERROR_RATE_FOR_OPTIMIZATION improves the critical exponent of this recursive algorithm as
# analyzed by the master theorem, but worsens the constant for the non-recursive base case of witness listing.
# this constant can interestingly vary between (0,1/2) non inclusive
# Dynamically changing the error rate based on input size seems feasible but hard.
