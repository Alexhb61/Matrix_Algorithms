# combining things notes:
sample witness count O(n) times
lets us estimate the error rate of:
structured sample of witnesses <- witness list algorithm but only do a sublist
dense dropping of witnesses by index <- dense algorithm
I'm tempted to try and complete the dense algorithm via a triangle finding algorithm.
By finding triangles to remove the false negatives in the dense algorithm.
When many triangles are present, brute force can check them.
